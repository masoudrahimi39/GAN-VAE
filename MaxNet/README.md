## Project Description
Perform a simulation for x=(1.2, 1.1, 1, 0.9, 0.95,1.15) and with ϵ=0.15 and show the steps of updating the units and then answer the following questions.
- Explain under what conditions and with what corrections the Maxnet network can be used to find the largest number among the numbers that we know are all greater than 𝛽𝜖𝑅.
- Under what circumstances and with what modifications can the Maxnet network mechanism be used to sort numbers from large to small.
- In what conditions and with what modifications can the Maxnet network mechanism be used to sort numbers from small to large.
