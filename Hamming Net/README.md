Consider vectors of features with values 1 and 1 - (meaning having and not having that feature) of length 6 and 3 base vectors with the same size (as in part 2), we want to based on the degree of similarity between each feature vector in the input With base vectors, let's make a category so that the input vector is more similar to each base vector and is placed in that category.

1) Describe the architecture used for this (including the number of layers, the number of neurons) in each layer.

2) Suppose we want to apply the following ten feature vectors as input to the network and perform classification based on the 3 existing base vectors. Implement this network with the help of Python programming language and show the results in your report.
