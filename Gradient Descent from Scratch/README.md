# Linear Regression Coefficient Estimation with Gradient Descent

## Overview

This project is a hands-on exploration of implementing the gradient descent algorithm to find coefficients in linear regression. We delve into two distinct approaches:

1. **From Scratch**: We start with the fundamentals and build our own gradient descent algorithm from scratch.

2. **Using PyTorch**: We leverage the power of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to streamline and optimize our coefficient estimation process.
