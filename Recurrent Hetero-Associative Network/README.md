## ## Project Description
The remarkable thing about Bidirectional Associative Memory networks is that they have mapping properties on both sides.
1) Use the following two templates in the BAM network to create a proper two-way mapping, then
Generate and display the output from both sides (black color) for correct network performance
Code with +1 and white as -1.)
2) Enter the disturbance into the image patterns so that the hamming distance with the original image is about 30%, display the output (which is equal to the name of the image in the unperturbed state) and compare and analyze the performance of the network.
