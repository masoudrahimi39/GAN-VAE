## Project description
An important point in working with associative memory neural networks is the number of vectors that can be stored. In this question, we want to address this issue.
1) Save the vector ùëÜ=[1,1,1,‚àí1] using Modified Hebbian Learning Method.
2) Now, save the desired second vector in such a way that the network can retrieve it.
3) State under what conditions the network will not be able to store the new vector? Give an example.
4) Do the same until a new vector cannot be stored in the network. up to a few vectors
Can it be stored in the network so that the network can retrieve them?
5) State a general rule for the number of vectors that can be stored in a network with n inputs.
Implement the answer of different sections in Python language and explain fully about the answer of each section in your report.
