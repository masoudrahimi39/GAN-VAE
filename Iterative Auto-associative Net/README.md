### Project Description

In self-associative networks, the input and output data are the same. The performance of these networks is measured by their ability to reproduce a stored pattern from a noisy input.
1) Using the Modified Hebbian Learning Method, save the vector 𝑺=[𝟏,𝟏,𝟏,−𝟏]
2) Check the performance of the network in the case that the information of three of the four input values is lost and zeroed (check every permutation and possible state). Report your results.
3) Check the performance of the network in the case that three mistakes and displacements have occurred in the input vector.
(check every possible permutation and state). Report your results.
4) Perform the above three steps in order using Discrete Hopfield Net.
5) Calculate the number of patterns that can be stored with Discrete Hopfield Net.
6) Report, stating the reason, which of the two networks you used and checked, for
This works more appropriately.
