## Project Description

Using the Mexican Hat network, find the unit that has the maximum value from the vector below.
[ 0.27, 0.35, 0.44, 0.58, 0.66, 0.77, 0.4, 0.32, 0.20, 0.15, 0.08 ]

1) Consider R1=0 and R2=∞.

2) Consider R1=1 and R2=3.

Attention:
• Draw the index of the array members and the value of the output signal every time it repeats, and finally
Compare the results of the two parts. (consider maxt and other parameters to be appropriate values)
• For both parts, consider the activation function as follows:

Here's the revised text with corrections to make it error-free:

"In Part A, when the radius of cooperation is zero and the radius of competition is infinite, all neighboring neurons become competitors. In this scenario, the absolute maximum is selected, which corresponds to the fifth index.

However, in Part B, when the radius of cooperation is one and the radius of competition is two, the fourth index is chosen as the maximum. This decision is based on the understanding that not only the value of the node itself matters but also the size of the neighborhood. In this way, the selection process prioritizes the richer area."
