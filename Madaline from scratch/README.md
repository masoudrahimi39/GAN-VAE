Consider the following set:

- In this set, the blue points are fixed.
- The orange category contains 50 points, with the coordinates of each point specified as (x1, x2). x1 is randomly generated with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 0.2, and x2 with a mean of 2.5 and a standard deviation of 0.3.
- The green category also includes 50 points, with the coordinates of each point specified as (x1, x2). x1 has a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.2, and x2 has a mean of 2 and a standard deviation of 0.2.

Design a Madline network that separates these points from one another using appropriate lines.


Results:
It can classify all points except two.
